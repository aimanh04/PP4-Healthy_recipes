## USER EXPERIENCE

#### Agile Methodology

</details>
The Healthy Recipes project followed Agile methodology, using iterative sprints to prioritize key features and improve based on user feedback. The MoSCoW method helped classify features, ensuring core functionalities like browsing, authentication, and recipe management were developed first. Continuous testing and refinements kept the platform user-friendly and responsive.

#### MoSCoW

</details>
This project applied the MoSCoW prioritization technique to categorize its features and requirements based on their significance in achieving a minimum viable product (MVP). The MoSCoW method divides features into four groups: "Must have," "Should have," "Could have," and "Won't have," ensuring a structured approach to prioritization. By using this framework, the project focuses first on the most critical elements, guaranteeing that essential functionalities are addressed before less urgent ones.

## DESIGN

### Color Scheme

![Color Scheme](readme/features/palette.png)

### Database Models

#### 1. User Model
- Django's AllAuth package is used as the authentication system, managing user registration and login.
- The model includes essential fields like username, email, and password.
- A single user can create multiple recipes, establishing a one-to-many relationship between the User and Recipe models.

#### 2. Recipe Model
- The Recipe model allows users to browse various dishes, while registered users can contribute their own.
- A one-to-many relationship is maintained, as one user can submit multiple recipes.
- Users can input details such as recipe title, brief description, featured image, preparation and cooking time, serving size, list of ingredients, step-by-step directions, and any additional notes.
- Some fields, including slug (auto-generated from the title), author (linked to the logged-in user), and timestamps for creation and modification, are automatically set.
- The model supports a many-to-many relationship for likes, enabling users to express approval of recipes. These likes are displayed on both the homepage and individual recipe pages.
- Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities are available for users managing their own recipes.

#### 3. Comment Model
- Registered users can post comments on recipes, with multiple comments being linked to a single recipe in a many-to-one relationship.
- Comments display relevant details, including the author, date, and time of submission.
- Users can create, read, edit, and delete their own comments.

#### 4. Recipe Likes Model
- This model lets users show appreciation for recipes by liking them.
- A many-to-one relationship connects multiple likes to a single recipe.
- Users have the ability to remove their likes whenever they choose.

#### 5. About Model
- This model provides visitors with background information about the platform and about myself.
- Fields include a header image, title, and descriptive content.
- Only the site administrator has permission to update this information, with full CRUD access.

#### 6. Contact Model
- This model enables communication between users and site administrators by collecting visitor details.
- Fields include name, email address and a message input for queries or feedback.
- Submitted messages are directed to the admin dashboard, where administrators can manage, update statuses, and mark them as "read."
